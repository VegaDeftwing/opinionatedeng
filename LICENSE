Nobody knows. Let's be real, things like the XKCD's are copyrighted and there's some gray area with some of the content with unknown publishers. It's open source and educational material, so I'm realatively comfortable claiming fair use and I know the guys at XKCD are cool. But really, don't try to sell this as a printed book or anything, for one thing, that's a dick move when it's available online, here, for free, for another you'll get sued.

This book is also beerware, that is, if you enjoy it then I'd appriciate it if you buy me a beer if you see me in person. (or more accurately a Shirley Temple, I may be old enough to drink, but they're still pretty bomb)
