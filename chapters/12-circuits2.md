# Chapter 12 - Diodes,  Transistors, and Integrated Circuits

[TODO]

Show everything in a circuit sim

## Transformers, Variacs

## Diodes, the one way road

zeener, normal, bipolar

+ varistors , sparkgaps
+ Leds - getting current both ways, LED safety

### Diode Logic

## Transistors

tubes and how they work

### PNP V NPN

### IGBT, Mosfets?

## Integrated Circuits

## Optical Electronics

## Crystal Oscilators

## PWM

## ADC/DAC

## Active Filters

## Audio Devices

speakers, piezos, amps, mics and pickup patters

# Relating AC and Music

[TODO]

Relate back to things like ADRS, Distortion, Reverb / Echo, Decibels (audio), etc. Use VCV RACK

## Continued Reading:

At this point I highly recommend *'Practical Electronics for Inventors'* ISBN 978-1259587542, namely chapters 2-12, and 15-16. It's a very large, detailed book that does it's best to keep things, well, practical.
