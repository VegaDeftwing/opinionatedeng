# Chapter 7 - Let's write some python

## The building blocks of programming

[TODO]
if, while, for (and specialized), assignment, comparison, combined ops (+=), mod, exponent, floor,
in/not in, is/is not, data types, functions
libraries

## Common methods used

commenting-out

## Making a full project

### Part 1, Starting easy

[TODO] guide to write an OO python program with libraries to read and write entries to a database-like file and a real database
the database should have 3 tables, a to-do list, a time-tracker list, and a list of articles

To-do: NAME, DUEDATE
time-tracker: 2types, either manually enterend with NAME, TSTART, TSTOP or NAME, TTOTAL for the following program
articles: NAME, PUBLISHED, TPUB, TEDIT

we'll need some way to track what items in the time tracker were started, but never stopped

for now, everything should be strictly command line arguments and print statments

## More advanced topics

lambdas(high level only), threads/ parrallelization(high level only), interupts (actually, let's save this until embbeded), apis,
