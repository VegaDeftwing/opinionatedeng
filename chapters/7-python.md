# Chapter 7 - Let's write some python

From https://wiki.xxiivv.com/#development:
> Prototype before polishing. Get it working before optimizing it.
> Separate policy from mechanism; separate interfaces from engines.
> Write simple modular parts connected by clean interfaces.
> Design programs to be connected to other programs.
> Write programs to write programs when you can.
> Design for the future, because it will be here sooner than you think.
> In interface design, always do the least surprising thing.
> When a program has nothing surprising to say, it should say nothing.
> When a program must fail, it should fail noisily and as soon as possible.
> Write big programs only when it is clear by demonstration that nothing else will do.

Programming can seem scary at first but [TODO]

## The building blocks of programming

[TODO]
if, while, for (and specialized), assignment, comparison, combined ops (+=), mod, exponent, floor,
in/not in, is/is not, data types, functions
libraries

## Common methods used

commenting-out
print debugging
Recursion, object orientation
while(true)
try/catch

## Some simple programs

### Hello World

fully discect each line and call and why each line is used, ASCII table

add greating and input

### Even or Odd, prime,

### Calculating sine and pi

### Sorting a list

### Palindromes

### Cypher

## Making a full project

### Part 1, Starting easy

[TODO] guide to write an OO python program with libraries to read and write entries to a database-like file and a real database
the database should have 3 tables, a to-do list, a time-tracker list, and a list of articles

To-do: NAME, DUEDATE
time-tracker: 2types, either manually enterend with NAME, TSTART, TSTOP or NAME, TTOTAL for the following program
articles: NAME, PUBLISHED, TPUB, TEDIT

we'll need some way to track what items in the time tracker were started, but never stopped

for now, everything should be strictly command line arguments and print statments

## More advanced topics

lambdas(high level only), threads/ parrallelization(high level only), interupts (actually, let's save this until embbeded), apis,

## A little more practice
