#### Purpose:
I've got a lot of random knowledge floating around in my skull, and I've done countless of hours of internet browsing to find cool things that intrest me.
Along the way I've tried hundreds of programs, tools, and hacks and I've found which ones work for me and which ones dont. Furthermore, I get asked on a regular basis "How'd your learn all of this" and the answer is by failure, time commitment, and going down a lot of dead ends. I still think these things are necessary for learning, but I also think a straight forward guide that leads people though these things while still providing a challange would be useful.

There are plenty of 'Awesome Whatever' repos on github, but there's far too much information there to wade though to pick what resources are truly important and avoid reading or watching the same thing a dozen times. After the 256th explanation, I not only know how a buffer overflow works, but I'm tired of hearing about them. The point of this is to save you time as you learn. A crash course that avoids all the repition and that goes in depth enough to really hit the advanced topics, but friendly enough to not feel like a text book.

That, and it's a pretty slick way of taking notes for my own use and finding gaps in my own knowledge ┐( ˘_˘)┌
