[TODO]

## Discrete Math

Truth tables, binary, logical equlivencies, propositional logic,

Sets, functions, relations, recurrence, induction, combonation, graphs, isomorphsm,

## Complexity analsis

+recursion analysis, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX40hbAHx3s (p np)

## Brute Force

## Data structures

trees, hashtables/maps, stacks

## Practice

Fib, some pracice logical equliv, base conversion algo, overlapping lines, matrix multiplication
