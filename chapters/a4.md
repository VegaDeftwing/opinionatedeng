Becuase you're now somebody in the know about topics relating to technology and have a deeper understanding about issues that may effect the pubilc, such as [The FBI V Apple encryption case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBIâ€“Apple_encryption_dispute), [Issues regrading internet speed and infrastructure](https://gizmodo.com/why-americas-internet-is-so-shitty-and-slow-1686173744), or [The Government/NSA spying on people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_641A).

This is a major factor in why so many technical people host their own servers and build a lot of the crazy things they do. As a result you'll hear a lot about rooting or getting superuser on various devices as well as [Right to Repair](https://repair.org/).

Finally, many in the tech community are on the heartbeat of issues surounding copyright, fairuse, and the [Digital Millennium Copyright Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act) or DMCA as without exceptions , a lot of security research would not be legal and it's of direct importance to issues like software piracy and issues sorunding Youtube's automated ContentID [TODO: add links]
