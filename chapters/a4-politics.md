# Appendix D - Polotics and Ethics

> Don't feed the Trolls

Becuase you're now somebody in the know about topics relating to technology and have a deeper understanding about issues that may effect the pubilc, such as [The FBI V Apple encryption case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI–Apple_encryption_dispute), [Issues regrading internet speed and infrastructure](https://gizmodo.com/why-americas-internet-is-so-shitty-and-slow-1686173744), or [The Government/NSA spying on people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_641A). There are plenty of issues that weather you like it or not you're one of the few with enough informationg to truly understand and inform your peers. A well known digital writes and freedom advocacy group you may consider supporting is the [Electronic Frontier Foundation or EFF](www.eff.org), as they do some absolutely incredible work making sure we maintain our digital rights both in the role of consumers as well as hackers, tinkerers, security reseachers and nerds. You may consider checking out [Free press](https://www.freepress.net/) as well, though above all else educating yourself and others about issues to end ignorance and fear when it comes to these issues is more valuable than anything else.

Furthermore, there's a general view in the technical community that we should help push adoption of superior platfroms. This is usually either for a push for [decentralized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrA7XTDCtok) services like [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) or [Dat](https://datproject.org/), or a push for FOSS (Free and Open Source) software like Linux or LibreOffice.

Most in the technical community belive that you should have full control over the devices you own. This is a major factor in why so many technical people host their own servers and build a lot of the crazy things they do. As a result you'll hear a lot about rooting or getting superuser or root on various devices as well as [Right to Repair](https://repair.org/).

Many in the tech community are on the heartbeat of issues surounding copyright, fairuse, and the [Digital Millennium Copyright Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act) or DMCA as without exceptions, a lot of security research would not be legal and it's of direct importance to issues like software piracy and issues sorunding Youtube's automated ContentID [TODO: add links]

Moving on from that though, there is increasingly a concern about energy consumption and enviormental consequences of technology use. Data centers alone are already consuming over 2% of the worlds electricity and that number is set to grow exponentially in the coming years. Becuase of this having a light, fast, http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/ instead of a bloated, javascript heavy page actually matters. http://gauthierroussilhe.com/en/posts/convert-low-tech as well as https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2016/05/how-to-go-off-grid-in-your-apartment.html are good sites that go more in depth on this issue. Now, at the same time, I'm not going to act all high and mighty, my desktop and monitors use in excess of 300w, but it is still something to be mindful of.

> The Four Essential Freedoms
> The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
> The freedom to study how the program works, and change it.
> The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others.
> The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.

The hacker and information freedom community has multiple 'sacred texts' if you will, which I think do a good job of outlining some of the ideologies of the communities. Probably the most famous is the Guerilla Open Access Manifesto written by Aaron Swartz, an amazing man that, according to Wikipedia "was involved in the development of the web feed format RSS and the Markdown publishing format, the organization Creative Commons, and the website framework web.py, and was a co-founder of the social news site Reddit". Due to his extensive work in online politics his wikipedia page almost acts like a hub of sorts for relevent information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz. The full text of the Guerilla Open Access Manifesto is below:

> Information is power. But like all power, there are those who want to keep it for
> themselves. The world's entire scientific and cultural heritage, published over centuries
> in books and journals, is increasingly being digitized and locked up by a handful of
> private corporations. Want to read the papers featuring the most famous results of the
> sciences? You'll need to send enormous amounts to publishers like Reed Elsevier.
>
> There are those struggling to change this. The Open Access Movement has fought
> valiantly to ensure that scientists do not sign their copyrights away but instead ensure
> their work is published on the Internet, under terms that allow anyone to access it. But
> even under the best scenarios, their work will only apply to things published in the future.
> Everything up until now will have been lost.
>
> That is too high a price to pay. Forcing academics to pay money to read the work of their
> colleagues? Scanning entire libraries but only allowing the folks at Google to read them?
> Providing scientific articles to those at elite universities in the First World, but not to
> children in the Global South? It's outrageous and unacceptable.
>
> "I agree," many say, "but what can we do? The companies hold the copyrights, they
> make enormous amounts of money by charging for access, and it's perfectly legal —
> there's nothing we can do to stop them." But there is something we can, something that's
> already being done: we can fight back.
>
> Those with access to these resources — students, librarians, scientists — you have been
> given a privilege. You get to feed at this banquet of knowledge while the rest of the world
> is locked out. But you need not — indeed, morally, you cannot — keep this privilege for
> yourselves. You have a duty to share it with the world. And you have: trading passwords
> with colleagues, filling download requests for friends.
>
>
>
> Meanwhile, those who have been locked out are not standing idly by. You have been
> sneaking through holes and climbing over fences, liberating the information locked up by
> publishers and sharing them with your friends.
>
> But all of this action goes on in the dark, hidden underground. It's called stealing or
> piracy, as if sharing a wealth of knowledge were the moral equivalent of plundering a
> ship and murdering its crew. But sharing isn't immoral — it's a moral imperative. Only
> those blinded by greed would refuse to let a friend make a copy.
>
> Large corporations, of course, are blinded by greed. The laws under which they operate
> require it — their shareholders would revolt at anything less. And the politicians they
> have bought off back them, passing laws giving them the exclusive power to decide who
> can make copies.
>
> There is no justice in following unjust laws. It's time to come into the light and, in the
> grand tradition of civil disobedience, declare our opposition to this private theft of public
> culture.
>
> We need to take information, wherever it is stored, make our copies and share them with
> the world. We need to take stuff that's out of copyright and add it to the archive. We need
> to buy secret databases and put them on the Web. We need to download scientific
> journals and upload them to file sharing networks. We need to fight for Guerilla Open
> Access.
>
> With enough of us, around the world, we'll not just send a strong message opposing the
> privatization of knowledge — we'll make it a thing of the past. Will you join us?

Finally, I'd like to make a few notes about online communities, trolling, hate speech, and the like. Clearly the tech industry leans significantly on the liberal/libertarian side; however, most of us also strongly support your right to say whatever you like even if we don't support it. This is particually frustrating when it comes to large, non-grouped online communities like Twitter or Tumblr where except by blocking, everyone is in the same public sphere instead of isolated. While the isolation can have negitive effects too, like echo chambers where false information and hate breed, the samller communities are also benefical as they allow for a better sense of community and for individual moderation policies decided by the useres instead of awkward rules like [Tumblr's](https://gizmodo.com/tumblrs-porn-filter-flags-its-own-examples-of-permitted-1831151178?utm_source=gizmodo_twitter&utm_medium=socialflow&utm_campaign=socialflow_gizmodo_twitter&fbclid=IwAR2cfAMZ5IpJLINVt6WSuLCcu7KX5D83FQ8F4J-DTxbyJFMZ4704-VxTbN4) [NSFW](https://staff.tumblr.com/post/181199101690/hey-tumblr-a-couple-of-weeks-ago-we-announced-an) ban and the chaos that insued. Clearly the lines between hate speech and trolling and free speech are a problem online, and frankly the internet is young. We haven't really figured out the right way to handle it yet. Should Twitter have the right to remove the Alt-Right or are they to important of a polticial forum to deny freedom of speech despite being a public company? Is it ethically okay to use services like Tor for privacy when by doing so you're indirectly helping people get away with things like child ... abuse (I don't want this document getting flagged by something, ironically). Or because the tools are going to exist regardless and criminals will always find another way is it okay? The truth is, it's not black and white, and it's well worth your time to sit down and consider what you are personally okay with and what you think, as a society, we need to change and how we might go about doing that. Personally, I think services like Mastodon which offer security and privacy while keeping individual communities free to handle themselves are the best option, but they're also more complicated. Just know that decesion you make online can have real world consequences, and that at the end of the day, there's a human on the other side of that screen.

## Religion

![swearingin](../imgs/openg/swearingin.png)

The engineering community is strangly divided, the 'old gaurd' is actually realitively conservative and professional, but as time has moved forward it's quite the opposite. Unsuprisingly, this corolates with religion as well. The main way this plays into politics is a general hard stance for the separation of church and state. This is in part due to a past of religoutly motivated legilation negitively impacting copyright law, but also just generally an understood ideal that is beneficial to democracy. Furthermore, it would probably be worth your time to look into basics of most world religions, as engineering is incressingly a global field where you will have no choice but to work with people from diverse backgrounds across the globe.

## An NSFW Note

The 'Hacking' community in particular is usally very clear on sexual liberation/freedoms and given that techinally minded people tend to have statitically significantly higher ammouns of LGBTQIA+ people, it's relevent to mention. I don't want to go in depth or be your source of sex education, but I do think skipping over this would be doing the community some injustice. As such I'd also like to link to some videos providing sexual education, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-q-tSHo9Ho&list=FLFMnqfaTa1se1LfbCB3peJQ&index=103&t=0s

Finally, a little less NSFW, the Maker and engineering communities also tend to overlap rather heavily with more artisticaly minded and sub-culture heavy groups, ranging from those obsessed with comics to anime nerds or furries. I really recomend you do at least a little reseach into various sub cultrues and geek culture to better understand some of the people you'll probably interact with. You might just find something new you enjoy while you're at it.

Also, because this got a bit heavy for a bit, let's touch on Rule 34. We all know it, but where does it come from? 4Chan of course. Here's the full set:

## Thank you
If you've made it this far I just want to say thank you. We need more people to really consider the ethics of technology as we design it and procede with it. DeepFakes, Automated driving, and even more mass online censorship are issues we're only going to face more with time and it's people like you who are going to help make sure we take the best path we can. So, from the bottom of my heart, thank you.
