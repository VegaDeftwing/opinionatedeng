# Chapter 12 - Diodes,  Transistors, and Integrated Circuits

[TODO]

Show everything in a circuit sim, fix heading levels (this is a mess)

## Transformers, Variacs

[TODO]

## Diodes, the one way road

[TODO]

zeener, normal, bipolar

+ varistors , sparkgaps
+ Leds - getting current both ways, LED safety

### Diode Logic

## Transistors

[TODO]

tubes and how they work

### PNP V NPN

### IGBT, Mosfets?

## Integrated Circuits

[TODO]

## PWM

[TODO]

## ADC/DAC

[TODO]

## Active Filters

[TODO]

## Audio Devices

[TODO]

speakers, piezos, amps, mics and pickup patters

## TODO

add motors, analog meters, various connection standards, radio, flex/pressure sense, grounding (chasis, digital, analog, ground planes, etc.), solar/photo reactive,

# Relating AC and Music

[TODO]

Relate back to things like ADRS, Distortion, Reverb / Echo, Decibels (audio), etc. Use VCV RACK

## Continued Reading:

[TODO]

At this point I highly recommend *'Practical Electronics for Inventors'* ISBN 978-1259587542, namely chapters 2-12, and 15-16. It's a very large, detailed book that does it's best to keep things, well, practical.
