# Chapter 21 - Exploitation

Often when we think about Exploitation, better known as hacking, we conjur images of a more-punk-than-cyber cyberpunk person clicking away wildly on a keyboard as code flies by, like the [1995 movie, Hackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_(film)), and to some extent this isn't wrong, as one look around the floor at [DefCon](https://www.defcon.org/), will show you. And honestly, that's to by accident. While there are strictly professional security experts, those that work at corperations and banks, a large number do it for the lolz, for fun, and to bring a little fun back into computing. Calling exploitation 'hacking' is almost a misnome, as hacking encompases a lot more than exploitation, and exploitation a lot more than hacking. For that reason, before we start, I recomend you watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjge1bVobN0), on speed running Super Mario 64, this is a prime example of exploitation in a non-harmful manner done for fun.

## Types of exploits

[TODO] - where to put return oriented programming, super old hardware/software - 'the home router',

Otherwise known as hacking, exploitation of software is always alluring, though in reality like many things it is much less glamorous than the news or tv make it out to be. Before I get into it I want to plug 'The Art of Exploitation' by Jon Erickson again, as it truly is a masterpiece that describes exploiting in a way that just makes sense

### Software

Injection - SQL

breaking hashes

Heap/buffer overflow

dangaling pointers

code-injection

clock attacks

Race conditions

Path traversel

format string

pseudo-random

Fuzzing

#### Networking

DoS/DDoS

MitM

XXS

MAC/IP spoofing

sniffing

### Hardware

Talk about CPU bugs

Power side channel

Timing attacks

pseudo-random (hardware side)

Hardware trust (HID injection)

replay attacks

radio, rfid, etc

### Social Engineering

Phishing

spoofing (email, phone)

UTF-8 v ASCII

click jacking

expired certificate

default passwords

honey pots

### Physical security

Lock picking as a last resort

data destruction

## Malware

> Section here about not being a dick

Viruses

polymorphic

boot-record

trojan

logic/comression bomb

logic/time bombs

ransomware

adware/spyware

## Tools of the trade

Many tools in common with debugging (gdb - gef, hex editors, logic analzer)

and testing (fuzzing)

decompilers, dissassembly, analysis

Wireshark

## Getting some practice

### CTF-Time

As mentioned above in [Chapter 17- Compilers and Assemblers](#chapter-17--compilers-and-assemblers) At this point I highly recommend '[The Art of Exploitation](https://nostarch.com/hacking2.htm)' by Jon Erickson

CTF time,
